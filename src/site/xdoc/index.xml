      <subsection name="What is HST - Spring Framework Support?">
        <p>
          This project provides components which fill the gap between HST-2 framework and Spring Framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, HST-2 supports 
          <a href="http://www.onehippo.org/library/concepts/translations/hst-2-dynamic-resource-bundles-support.html">Repository Dynamic ResourceBundle</a>
          stored in the repository.
          However, <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.13.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#context-functionality-messagesource">Spring Framework Internationalization Support with MessageSource</a>
          is unaware of how to retrieve HST-2 Dynamic ResourceBundles using HST-2 API.
          Therefore, this project provides <a href="apidocs/org/onehippo/forge/hst/spring/support/HstRepositoryResourceBundleMessageSource.html">HstRepositoryResourceBundleMessageSource</a>
          to be able to use HST-2 Dyanmic ResourceBundles as well as the default Java ResourceBundles provided by Spring Framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, this project supports a
          <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.13.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/HandlerExceptionResolver.html">HandlerExceptionResolver</a>
          which can handle HST page not found exception to forward the request
          to the specified HST 'page-not-found' sitemap item path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever there's any gap found between HST-2 Framework and Spring Framework,
          this project will keep providing proper solutions to make seamless integration between two.
